zip: Looping Through Multiple Lists
Simultaneously.
Imagine you have two lists of related items,
like names and ages. 

You want to loop through both at the same
timeâ€”one item from each list.
That's where zip comes in handy!

How zip Works
zip combines multiple lists (or sequences)
into pairs, so you can loop through them
together
'''
# Example of zip
# fruits = ['apple', 'mango', 'grapes']
# count = [40, 55, 500]

# for fruit, count_ in zip(fruits, count):
#     print(f"There are {count_} {fruit} in the store.")

'''
enumerate: Adding a Counter to Your Loop
Now, let's say you want to loop through a
list but also need to know the index
(position) of each item as you go. 

Instead
of manually creating a counter, you can use
enumerate to get the index automatically!
'''
# Example of enumerate

fruits = ['apple', 'mango', 'grapes']
for index,fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f'Fruit {index+1}: {fruit}')
